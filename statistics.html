The term "Z-test" is often used to refer specifically to the 
one-sample location test comparing the mean of a set of measurements to a given constant. 
A t-test can be used to account for the uncertainty in the sample variance when 
the sample size is small and the data are exactly normal. There is no universal 
constant at which the sample size is generally considered large enough to justify 
use of the plug-in test. Typical rules of thumb range from 20 to 50 samples. 
For larger sample sizes, the t-test procedure gives almost identical p-values as the Z-test procedure.
if the sample size is large enough, very small differences from the null value can be highly statistically significant.
